## JPEG Compression Algorithm Implementation

### GOALS

- Learn about image processing raw image formats and compression algorithms
- Trying not to use any dependencies
- Potentially could become be an OSS alternative to Adobe's DNG converter

### NOTE: Raw Images
DNG or TIFF6? Depends on how complex this gets

### DESC
